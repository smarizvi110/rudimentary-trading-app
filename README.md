# Rudimentary Trading App

## ~April 2024

A project I used to learn using the MERN Stack â€“ TypeScript for web development.

- Implements user authentication, trade creation, offer submissions, and profile management.  
- Manages data storage and retrieval using MongoDB with Mongoose to ensure data handling for user trades and offers using a non-relational database.  
- Employs a component-based architecture for the frontend using TypeScript, ensuring reusable and scalable UI components.
